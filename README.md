-LazY V2.9 – Software Downloader & Tweaks Tool
LazY V2.9 is a Windows batch script that lets you quickly download popular software or (in the future) apply system tweaks — all from a colorful, old-school command-line menu.
Think of it like a mini app store, but made entirely from a .bat file.

-Features
Easy Navigation – Simple menu system with keyboard input.
Quick Software Downloads – Installs from official sources using curl.
Colorful UI – ANSI color codes to make the menus look less boring.
Portable – Just one .bat file, no installation needed.
Tweaks Menu (Coming Soon) – Placeholder for Windows performance tweaks.

-Included Software
From the Software Menu, you can download:
Discord (app + server invite)
Steam, Epic Games, Rockstar Launcher, Riot Games (Valorant)
Logitech G HUB, SpotX, WinRar
Browsers: Brave, Google Chrome
Developer Tools: Visual Studio Code, Node.js, Python
Creative Apps: OBS Studio, DaVinci Resolve, Blender, SketchUp, CapCut
Utility Apps: Rufus, Core Temp, MSI Afterburner, NotePad++, XTU Setup
All download links go directly to official sources, so no shady mirrors.

-How to Use
Download the LazY V2.9.bat file.
Right-click → "Run as Administrator" (recommended for some installs).
Pick a menu option using the number keys.
The script will use curl to download the installer into your Downloads folder.
Once downloaded, just run the installer manually.

-Notes & Tips
Internet Required – The script pulls files directly from the internet.
Run in CMD, not PowerShell – Some ANSI colors may break in PowerShell.
Check File Names – Some installers might be .msi or .zip instead of .exe.
CapCut Link Broken – Currently uses a blob: URL, which won’t work in curl. You’ll need a direct download link.

-Planned Features
Functional Tweaks Menu with registry and performance optimizations.
Better error handling for failed downloads.
Option to auto-run installers after downloading.
Add more popular software.
